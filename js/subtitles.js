"and then the baby monkeys were lost!" + "\n" + 
"in the trees" + "\n" + 
"what happened then?" + "\n" + 
"They had taken a very long trip" + "\n" + 
"They did not even take the train" + "\n" + 
"they couldn\'t pay" + "\n" + 
"they were in some frightening trees" + "\n" + 
"with popotamus" + "\n" + 
"hippos, crocodiles, monsters, ghosts " + "\n" + 
"so they fought, fought" + "\n" + 
"and the lion won!" + "\n" + 
"and he was the king" + "\n" + 
"he had a helmet" + "\n" + 
"a sword" + "\n" + 
"and..." + "\n" + 
"how do you say when you protect yourself?" + "\n" + 
"a shield!" + "\n" + 
"and magic powers!" + "\n" + 
"And then they saw many things" + "\n" + 
"very pretty things" + "\n" + 
"there were flowers" + "\n" + 
"the sun!" + "\n" + 
"the clouds!" + "\n" + 
"MANY things!" + "\n" + 
"but there was something going amiss" + "\n" + 
"because there was a crocodile" + "\n" + 
"who was sleeping in the grass" + "\n" + 
"and when you stepped on it, it would wake up" + "\n" + 
"and it would eat the babies!" + "\n" + 
"so, something goes amiss again" + "\n" + 
"because the hippo is not in the water" + "\n" + 
"and he prefers to kill himself" + "\n" + 
"so the lion kills the hippo" + "\n" + 
"and they go to heaven" + "\n" + 
"but the hippo didn\'t know" + "\n" + 
"he didn\'t want to go to heaven" + "\n" + 
"so he decided" + "\n" + 
"not to go to heaven" + "\n" + 
"but the lion said \"it\'s too late now\"" + "\n" + 
"\"you decided to be dead in heaven!\"" + "\n" + 
"and then, it was well deserved for the lion" + "\n" + 
"because he had no more powers" + "\n" + 
"and then" + "\n" + 
"the power went the popotamus" + "\n" + 
"and the hippo was allergic to the magic" + "\n" + 
"the hippo and the lion and the tiger" + "\n" + 
"they got..." + "\n" + 
"spots" + "\n" + 
"they got the \"chicken-box\"" + "\n" + 
"then the \"chicken-box\" went to another animal" + "\n" + 
"who was very bad" + "\n" + 
"tremendously very bad" + "\n" + 
"and it was a..." + "\n" + 
"mammoth!" + "\n" + 
"mammoth had claws!" + "\n" + 
"powers so that people are dead in heaven!" + "\n" + 
"even the animals!" + "\n" + 
"and then..." + "\n" + 
"there was a lady who had a ring" + "\n" + 
"like yours, but it was different" + "\n" + 
"because it was orange" + "\n" + 
"then, the orange ring" + "\n" + 
"it would go  " + "\n" + 
"like this" + "\n" + 
"This way, people are peaceful" + "\n" + 
"and they can do whatever they want, and the kids as well." + "\n" + 
"Now it\'s over."
